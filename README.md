The awesome projects that related to MoveSpace.

[MoveSpace](https://movespace.xyz), an AI-powered ZKML Decentralized Datahouse. With decentralized data labeling and on-chain proof, using vector data, MoveSpace brings higher transparency to data labeling and data usage, providing high-performance AI and dapps with accelerated data engineering.

As of early November 2023, we have completed demos in multiple app settings such as gaming, DID, LLM, and search engines based on MoveSpaceDB, and support multiple EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.

Multiple repositories are included in the movespace, here is the list:

* [MoveDID](https://github.com/NonceGeek/MoveDID)

MoveDID is a DID protocol that is implemented Aptos.The vision of MoveDID is to be the foundation for the next generation of large-scale Web3 finance and Web3 society. MoveDID could be used for 3 types of subjects: human, organization, and bot.
The implementation follows the [did@w3c](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

* [MovespaceDB](https://github.com/NonceGeek/movespace_db)

  An AI-powered ZKML Decentralized Datahouse. With decentralized data labeling and on-chain proof, using vector data, MoveSpace brings higher transparency to data labeling and data usage, providing high-performance AI and dapps with accelerated data engineering.	

  * [Tai Shang Micro FaaS System](https://github.com/NonceGeek/tai_shang_micro_faas_system) 

    A Micro FaaS System that using Elixir snippets as edge funtions at runtime, which runs API module and data pipeline of Movespace.

  * [Movespace DB Uploader CLI](https://github.com/NonceGeek/movespace_db_uploader_cli)

      A CLI tool to interact with Movespace.

    * [Movespace Greenfield Client](https://github.com/NonceGeek/movespace-greenfield-client)

      dApp as a client, to upload data and metadata to greenfield network.

* Movespace-based Apps/dApps

  The awesome apps and dApps that buidl based on Movespace.

  * [AI Scaffold Aptos](https://github.com/NonceGeek/scaffold-aptos-based-on-AI)

     AI-based Scaffold Aptos is a smart contract and dApp programming copilot built on OpenAI and Web3 Vector Dataset.

  * [AI-based Smart Contract Explorer](https://github.com/NonceGeek/ai-based-smart-contract-explorer)

    An Ethereum Smart Contract Explorer based on AI.

* [ZK Credentials](https://github.com/NonceGeek/zk_credential/)

Combine zk data in credentials to achieve selective disclosure of credentials. Use zk-credentials as items of vector dataset to implement zk-based vector database.
