# awesome-movespace [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
The awesome projects in MoveSpace Cluster.

[MoveSpace](https://movespace.xyz) is AI-powered ZKML Decentralized Datahouse. We power LLMs with verifiable tamperproof datasets and developers with tamperproof zk outputs and data. Build new dapps with our database backend and AI-powered developer copilots today.

Multiple repoositories are included in the movespace, here is the list:

* [MoveDID](https://github.com/NonceGeek/MoveDID)

MoveDID is a DID protocol that is implemented Aptos.The vision of MoveDID is to be the foundation for the next generation of large-scale Web3 finance and Web3 society. MoveDID could be used for 3 types of subjects: human, organization, and bot.
The implementation follows the [did@w3c](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

* [MovespaceDB](https://github.com/NonceGeek/movespace_db)

MovespaceDB is a project to make vector dataset as Web3 Public Good and perma storage on Arweave Network. Public Vector Dataset allow public read permission, and using **Aptos Smart Contract** as the governancer of the write permission. It is also supportted the interaction with private vector dataset. This project are supportted by Embedbase.

* [AI Scaffold Aptos](https://github.com/NonceGeek/scaffold-aptos-based-on-AI)

AI-based Scaffold Aptos is a smart contract and dApp programming copilot built on OpenAI and Web3 Vector Dataset.

* [ZK Credentials](https://github.com/NonceGeek/zk_credential/)

Combine zk data in credentials to achieve selective disclosure of credentials. Use zk-credentials as items of vector dataset to implement zk-based vector database.
